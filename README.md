In this Unit, you will program a game to test the player’s reflexes, where the goal is to click and destroy objects randomly tossed in the air before they can fall off the screen. In creating this prototype, you will learn how to implement a User Interface - or UI - into your projects. You will add a title screen with a difficulty select menu that will control how challenging the gameplay is, you will add a score display that will track how many points the player has earned, and you will add a Game Over screen, which will allow the player to restart and try again. In learning these skills, you will be able to create a fully “playable” experience that the user can enjoy from start to finish without having to restart the application to try it again. 

Challenge Overview: 
Put your User Interface skills to the test with this whack-a-mole-like challenge in which you have to get all the food that pops up on a grid while avoiding the skulls.  You will have to debug buttons, mouse clicks, score tracking, restart sequences, and difficulty setting to get to the bottom of this one. 

Challenge Outcome:
1. All of the buttons look nice with their text properly aligned
2. When you select a difficulty, the spawn rate changes accordingly
3. When you click a food, it is destroyed and the score is updated in the top-left
4. When you lose the game, a restart button appears that lets you play again
